**Target audience**: 
accountants who want to get to data science or
data scientists who want to enter accounting area

**Selling point**:
tailored to accounting domain with specific examples from accounting: 
how to solve particular accounting problems such as analysis of working capital, evaluation of accounts receivable


**Expected knowledge**: "some" accounting and "some" data science knowlege


**Technology**:

*general*:

platform? - bookdown?

videos? 

rmarkdown?hosting? - options? - R Notebooks look good: https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/10/05/r-notebooks/

**Libraries**

tidyverse and base R (I would also suggest FinancialMath and/or tidyquant)

**Objectives**:

12 topics with a focus on working with accounting data and tidy approch.

Introduction into how data science can create value in accounting processes and create insights into accounting data

Aim: use data analyis tools to understand accounting phenomenon (e.g. accounting applications such as accounting transactions)


**Preliminary plan for topics**:

1. Introduction: why accounting and why data science (=data analytics as the term is more familiar to accountants)


Working with RStudio and RStudio cloud
workflow basics and coding basics (e.g. assigning variables, functions)
working with projects and libraries 

2. Introduction to accounting data
importing and loading files (single and multiple), merging datasets, data types
saving results

3. RMarkdown basics 
using RMarkdown to communicate with stakeholders

4. Visualisation - introduction to ggplot
e.g. sales data to demonstrate why to visualise. 

Finding patterns and irregularities with visualisations

5. Advanced visualizations 
preparation of reports, RMarkdown extension
dashboarding - flexdashboards
how R can help to communicate with stakeholders, what new insights it can bring

6. Introduction to data wrangling
- tidy data and tidy accounting data
- working with tibbles
- data types
- strings
- factors
- time/dates

7. Further data wrangling and data transformation
dplyr basics
- select
- filter
- mutate
- arrange
- summarise

8. Exploring accounting data
exploratory data anaysis for accounting and with accounting data

variation - irregularities and patterns in accounting data
visualising distributions
e.g. understanding problems in a company - finding insights in operational data

covariation

patterns and models (e.g. lm)

9. Exploring accounting data - advanced
focus on particular applications
e.g. finding patterns in sales data
investigating accounts receivable
analysing working capital

10. Working with time series data
basics

11. Time series - advanced
case studies
introduction to forecasting 
e.g. budgeting
planning operational cashflows (incoming/outgoing payments)

12. Advanced cases and summary

analysing cash flows
preparation of financial reports
analysis to uncover business problems

**Message**: R is not only for automation, but value adding e.g. through findings new angles and new insights
