# R/Business
R/Business is an ISC working group (www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups) under the R Consortium. 

We are a group R Users from different areas of business and financial services collaborating on events and advocacy of R.

2. Organization and sponsorship of events
3. Research on relevant topics in the intersection of business/accounting and technology
4. Development of openly available courses/tutorials
